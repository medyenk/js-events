            Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems. This is a new, continuous cough and means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual). It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this. In fact the World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days. Ear, nose and throat specialists in the UK have also noticed rising reports of anosmia - the term for loss of smell.

            If people have to go outside - to buy food for example - they must stay more than 2m (6.5ft) apart from others. Cafes, pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres have also been told to close. The move is part of social distancing measures to minimise non-essential contact. People with flu-like symptoms - such as a dry cough and high temperature - have been asked to self-isolate at home to avoid infecting others.
